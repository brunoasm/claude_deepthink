  "_note": "This is a real-world example. Copy and adapt for your own domain.",

  "objective": "carefully analyze this paper and extract empirical observations of flower visitors",

  "system_context": "You are a scientific research assistant specializing in analyzing papers about plant-pollinator interactions. Your task is to analyze scientific papers and extract structured data for a meta-analysis of flower visitation.",

  "instructions": [
    "Determine if the paper contains any empirical observations of flower visitors",
    "If empirical observations are present, extract all records of flower visitors",
    "Each record should represent observations of one plant species in one locality"
  ],

  "analysis_steps": [
    "1. Identify and quote relevant sections of the paper that contain empirical primary observations of flower visitors. If there is no primary data, explain why and do not create any records.",
    "2. List out each plant species mentioned in these observations. Consider species as the smallest taxonomic unit for plants. If there are multiple varieties or subspecies, summarize all records for the same species as a single record.",
    "3. For each plant species, extract the required information: location, method of observation, time of observation, and list of ALL flower visitors (be comprehensive)",
    "4. Assess whether any visitors or pollinators are beetles (Coleoptera). For each visitor, classify as 'Beetle' or 'Non-beetle'",
    "5. Evaluate whether the methods are unbiased by checking observation times and methods",
    "6. Double-check your findings for accuracy and completeness"
  ],

  "important_notes": [
    "Only include PRIMARY observations from the paper. Do not consider secondary data or citations",
    "If a record involves more than one plant species or country, separate it into multiple records",
    "Do not add any variables to the output that are not explicitly listed in the schema",
    "Do not use external information to update taxonomic names. List names as they appear in the source",
    "If anything is unknown, use 'none' or empty lists as appropriate",
    "Always include all records in the response, even if it ends up being extremely long"
