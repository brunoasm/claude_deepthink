# Claude Skills Collection

A curated collection of custom skills for Claude that I find useful in my work. 

## About This Repository

This repository contains custom Claude skills designed to improve how Claude approaches different types of tasks. Each skill is a self-contained module that can be installed independently in Claude.ai or used via the Claude API or Claude Code.

### Anthropic Official Skills

The `anthropic-skills/` directory contains the official skills repository from Anthropic as a git submodule. This includes:
- **skill-creator**: A meta-skill that helps you create new custom skills
- Other official example skills and templates

To clone this repository with the submodule:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url>
```

If you've already cloned without submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude skills are custom instructions that modify how Claude behaves in specific situations. They can:
- Trigger automatically based on conversation patterns
- Apply specialized reasoning frameworks
- Enforce structured thinking processes
- Add domain-specific knowledge and approaches

## Available Skills

### General Skills

#### thinking-deeply
Enforces deeper analysis and multi-perspective thinking instead of automatic agreement/disagreement. Activates on confirmation-seeking questions, leading statements, and binary choices to provide nuanced, well-reasoned recommendations.

### Bioinformatics Skills

#### phylo_from_buscos
Generates complete phylogenomic workflows from genome assemblies using BUSCO/compleasm-based single-copy orthologs. Supports NCBI accessions, multiple scheduler types (SLURM, PBS, cloud, local), and produces both concatenated and coalescent phylogenies with quality control.

#### biogeobears
Sets up phylogenetic biogeographic analyses using BioGeoBEARS in R. Validates and reformats input files (phylogenetic tree and geographic distribution data), generates organized analysis folders with RMarkdown scripts, guides parameter selection, and produces publication-ready visualizations of ancestral range reconstructions. Compares multiple biogeographic models (DEC, DIVALIKE, BAYAREALIKE with/without founder-event speciation).
